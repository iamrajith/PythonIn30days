## Boolean
- The Boolean data type represents either: `True` or `False`.
- It's used for logical and decision-making operations.

## Operators
### Assignment Operators
- Assign values to variables.
- Examples:
    ```python
    num = 10  # Integer
    pi = 3.14  # Float
    name = "Alice"  # String
    ```

### Arithmetic Operators
- Perform mathematical operations.
- Examples:
    ```python
    addition = 5 + 3
    subtraction = 10 - 4
    multiplication = 6 * 2
    division = 15 / 3
    ```

### Comparison Operators
- Compare values and return Boolean results.
- Examples:
    ```python
    greater_than = 7 > 5
    less_than_or_equal = 3 <= 5
    equal_to = 10 == 10
    not_equal = 8 != 12
    ```

### Logical Operators
- Combine Boolean values.
- Examples:
    ```python
    and_result = True and False
    or_result = True or False
    not_result = not True
    ```

## Variables
- Variables store data values.
- They can hold different data types (integers, floats, strings, etc.).

## Basic Operations
### Square and Square Root
- To calculate the square of a number, use the `**` operator.
- To find the square root, use the `** 0.5` operation.

## Examples
1. Calculate the square of a number:
    ```python
    num = 5
    square = num ** 2
    print(f"The square of {num} is {square}")
    ```

2. Find the square root of a number:
    ```python
    num = 25
    square_root = num ** 0.5
    print(f"The square root of {num} is approximately {square_root:.2f}")
    ```
