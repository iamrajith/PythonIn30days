    - Practice writing conditional statements and loops.
4. **Day 7-9: Functions and Error Handling**
    - Define functions and understand their importance.
    - Handle exceptions using try-except blocks.
    - Create reusable code with functions.

#### **Weeks 3-4: Intermediate Python Concepts**
5. **Day 10-12: Working with Lists and Dictionaries**
    - Explore lists (indexing, slicing, methods).
    - Understand dictionaries (key-value pairs, methods).
    - Solve practical problems using these data structures.
6. **Day 13-16: File I/O and Modules**
    - Read from and write to files.
    - Import and use Python modules (e.g., math, datetime).
